// Implementation of the `ApiRequest` trait for the `DescribeLoadBalancersReq` struct.
//
// This implementation allows the `DescribeLoadBalancersReq` struct to be used as part of an API request.
// The struct needs to be formatted into key-value pairs that can be sent as query parameters in the request URL
// or as the body of the HTTP request (depending on the API). The methods provided by this implementation
// allow the struct to be serialized into a `HashMap<String, String>` for query parameters, and a `Vec<u8>`
// for the body content. The conversion methods are essential for interacting with the external API and
// sending structured requests.
//
// The `DescribeLoadBalancersReq` struct represents a request to describe the load balancers in a given context.
// This struct will be converted into an appropriate request format for use in API calls.
//
// The methods included in this implementation are:
// - `to_hashmap`: Converts the struct into a key-value map for query parameters.
// - `to_body`: Prepares the body content of the HTTP request (currently empty).
//
// This implementation ensures that the `DescribeLoadBalancersReq` struct can be serialized and transmitted
// as part of an HTTP request, making it possible to interact with the corresponding API endpoint efficiently.
impl request::ApiRequest for lb_instance::DescribeLoadBalancersReq {
    // Converts the `DescribeLoadBalancersReq` struct into a `HashMap<String, String>`.
    // This method is used to format the struct fields into key-value pairs, which are suitable
    // for inclusion in an HTTP request's query parameters or body, depending on the context.
    // The key-value pairs represent the parameters of the API request.
    //
    // # Arguments:
    // - `self`: The `DescribeLoadBalancersReq` struct that contains the parameters to be sent in the request.
    //
    // # Returns:
    // - A `HashMap<String, String>` that contains the request parameters in a key-value format.
    //   This will be used to construct the query string or body of the HTTP request.
    fn to_hashmap(&self) -> HashMap<String, String> {
        // This calls the `format_request_to_hashmap` method from the `Request` trait (presumably)
        // to convert the struct fields into a proper `HashMap`.
        // It is likely that the `Request` trait implements the necessary logic for formatting fields
        // into the correct key-value pairs.
        request::Request::format_request_to_hashmap(self)
    }

    // Converts the `DescribeLoadBalancersReq` struct into a byte vector (`Vec<u8>`).
    // This method is responsible for preparing the body of the HTTP request. It can be useful
    // when sending POST requests with a body (like JSON or XML), but in this case, it returns an empty body.
    // You may need to customize it depending on the specific request needs (e.g., if the API expects JSON data).
    //
    // # Arguments:
    // - `self`: The `DescribeLoadBalancersReq` struct that will be sent in the body of the request.
    //
    // # Returns:
    // - A `Vec<u8>`, representing the body of the HTTP request. In this case, it is an empty vector,
    //   but this can be changed to include data like JSON or XML, depending on what the API expects.
    fn to_body(&self) -> Vec<u8> {
        // Initialize an empty vector, which could hold the body content in the future
        let result = Vec::new(); // Empty body; this might change depending on the request structure.
        result // Return the empty byte vector.
    }
}

// Implementation of the `ApiResponse` trait for the `DescribeLoadBalancersResp` struct.
//
// This implementation allows the `DescribeLoadBalancersResp` struct to handle the response
// from an API request. The struct will be populated with data from the HTTP response body,
// typically in JSON format, and will be converted into the corresponding Rust struct.
// The method provided by this implementation allows the struct to deserialize the response body
// into a usable struct that can be processed further in the application.
//
// The `DescribeLoadBalancersResp` struct represents the response data from an API call that
// describes load balancers. This struct is typically populated with various details about
// the load balancers and is used to relay the response data back to the caller.
//
// The methods included in this implementation are:
// - `to_struct`: This method takes an HTTP response and deserializes it into the `DescribeLoadBalancersResp` struct.
//   It ensures the response is in the expected format and populates the struct with the data received.
//
// This implementation makes the `DescribeLoadBalancersResp` struct suitable for use as an API response handler,
// allowing for easy transformation of the response into a Rust struct, enabling further processing or usage
// within the application.
impl response::ApiResponse for lb_instance::DescribeLoadBalancersResp {
    // Asynchronously processes the HTTP response and deserializes it into a `DescribeLoadBalancersResp` struct.
    // This method is called when the HTTP response from the server is received. It is used to parse the
    // JSON response body into the correct struct format, making it easier to work with the response data
    // programmatically.
    //
    // # Arguments:
    // - `http_response`: The HTTP response received from the API call, containing the JSON data that will
    //   be deserialized into the `DescribeLoadBalancersResp` struct.
    //
    // # Returns:
    // - A `Result<(), error::Error>` indicating the success (`Ok(())`) or failure (`Err(error::Error)`)
    //   of the operation. If successful, the struct is updated with the parsed response.
    //   If there is an error during parsing, an appropriate error is returned.
    async fn to_struct(&mut self, http_response: reqwest::Response) -> Result<(), error::Error> {
        // Attempt to parse the JSON response body into the `DescribeLoadBalancersResp` struct.
        let parsed_response: volcengine_sdk_protobuf::protobuf::lb_instance::DescribeLoadBalancersResp =
             http_response
                 .json() // Deserialize the JSON body of the HTTP response into the struct.

                 .map_err(|e| error::Error::ErrParseResponse(e))?; // If an error occurs during parsing, return a custom error.

        // After successfully parsing the response, assign the parsed struct to `self`.
        // This updates the current instance (`self`) with the parsed data.
